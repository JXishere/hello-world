# hello-world
The beginning of my coding journey


Hey everyone!

Jun here! You can call me JX too. Here i am in the github space to learn more about
the world or coding/programming! Im currently doing courses related to data science/data analysis.
And since im fairly new in this field/sector, i do hope to gain some guidance and help in this
open source community and garner more experience as i proceed further and deeper into this.
